  	<h1>The Most Endangered Animals in Africa
    
    
    <p>The Background
    <b><p>Africa is blessed with a stunning variety of wildlife – it has more species of charismatic megafauna than any other continent. However, sadly, with ever expanding human populations and their increasing demand for land, food and water, exacerbated by poaching, more and more species are becoming endangered. However, thanks to the foresight of conservationists past and present, many of the most endangered animals in Africa are being protected in reserves and national parks.  Below is a list of some of the most endangered species in Africa and where you stand a chance of seeing them.

   <head>1. Ethiopian Wolf</head>

<h2>Facts-->
    <a href="https://www.awf.org/wildlife-conservation/ethiopian-wolf" target=_blank><h3>Wildlife Conservation</h3></a>
    <p>The Bale Mountains of southern Ethiopia are home to 300 of the estimated 500 Ethiopian wolves left.Ethiopian wolves by M Harvey The mountainous terrain that the wolves depend on for survival is surrounded by agricultural land that provides the local people with the food they need to survive and is also used to graze livestock. The endangered wolves are threatened by habitat destruction and degradation, conflict with farmers and also by catching fatal diseases such as rabies and canine distemper virus (CDV) from the domestic dog populations. The latter can kill many of the wolves in a short space of time.</p>

    <head>2. Pangolin</head>

    <p>The poor pangolin has the dubious honor of being the most illegally trafficked species in Africa, as its scales are used in traditional medicine in Asia. Most people have never heard of a pangolin, let alone seen one … and sadly it is feared they are on a fast-track to extinction. Pangolins are now one of the most endangered animals in Africa. These delightful, gentle creatures are armour-plated and roll into a ball to defend themselves – unfortunately a poor defence against humans. Pangolins feed on ants and termites with their long sticky tongues, and the mother carries her young infant on her back. They are the holy grail of wildlife sightings for many tourists and indeed safari guides, such is their rarity.</p>


<head>3. Black Rhino</head>

<p>Black rhinos are the smaller of the two African rhino species. The most notable difference between white and black rhinos are their hooked upper lip. This distinguishes them from the white rhino, which has a square lip. Black rhinos are browsers rather than grazers, and their pointed lip helps them feed on leaves from bushes and trees. They have two horns, and occasionally a third, small posterior horn.

Populations of black rhino declined dramatically in the 20th century at the hands of European hunters and settlers. Between 1960 and 1995, black rhino numbers dropped by a sobering 98%, to less than 2,500. Since then, the species has made a tremendous comeback from the brink of extinction. Thanks to persistent conservation efforts across Africa, black rhino numbers have doubled from their historic low 20 years ago to between 5,042 and 5,455 today. However, the black rhino is still considered critically endangered, and a lot of work remains to bring the numbers up to even a fraction of what it once was—and to ensure that it stays there. Wildlife crime—in this case, poaching and black-market trafficking of rhino horn—continues to plague the species and threaten its recovery.</p>

  
<head>4. White Rhino</head>
<p>It is sad that, after successful conservation efforts increased their numbers dramatically in the 1960’s, once again, white rhino has become one of the most endangered animals in Africa. This is due to illegal poaching to satisfy the increased demand for their horn by Asian markets. Valiant conservation efforts are once again underway to save the white rhino, and South Africa is still its stronghold. The white rhino is larger than the black rhino and has square lips for grazing.</p>

<head>5. Mountian Gorilla</head>

 <p>As their name implies, mountain gorillas live in forests high in the mountains, at elevations of 8,000 to 13,000 feet. They have thicker fur, and more of it, compared to other great apes. The fur helps them to survive in a habitat where temperatures often drop below freezing. But as humans have moved more and more into the gorillas’ territory, the gorillas have been pushed farther up into the mountains for longer periods, forcing them to endure dangerous and sometimes deadly conditions.

What might have been a bleak outlook for the subspecies just a couple of decades ago has brightened in recent years due to conservation efforts. Despite ongoing civil conflict, poaching and an encroaching human population, both populations of mountain gorillas have increased in numbers</p>
